Welcome to Geneweb Audit's Documentation!
=========================================

This document is one of the results of OCamlPro's first mission over Geneweb.  
It consists mainly of two parts:

- A developer documentation, complementing the `Geneweb wiki <https://geneweb.tuxfamily.org/wiki/GeneWeb>`_.
  In turn, it provides an overview of the main components of Geneweb, in addition to the documentation for its 
  code part generated using **odoc**.

- An audit that gives recommendations starting from comments on the source code and ending with long term improvement
  advices. It was based on this `commit <https://github.com/OCamlPro/geneweb/commit/b34f9cc756d5b21792ebbe8d6e9f9ebf01eddd27>`_. 

In addition to the document, a `PR <https://github.com/geneweb/geneweb/pull/1288>`_ makes part of the mission results that, in turn : 

* Adds interfaces and documentation to the most of existing modules;
* Fixes:
   * CI execution with *appveyor.yml*;
   * Access to assets files with Secure module.
